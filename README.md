iTracker Reading App
====================

Inspired by [Spreeder](http://spreeder.com/), I wanted to create a speed reading app that displays the entire text.

My theory is that by using an [eye tracking mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking) with the entire text displayed, [peripheral vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_span) could play a part in increasesing absorption and retention of the reading material.

See [demo](http://remarkablemark.org/projects/iTracker).
