# iTracker Reading App

[iTracker](https://remarkablemark.org/iTracker/) is a speed reading app inspired by [Spreeder](https://www.spreeder.com/app.php). The difference between apps is iTracker displays all text and takes advantage of [peripheral vision](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_span) to increase the retention of material.

See [demo](https://remarkablemark.org/iTracker/).
